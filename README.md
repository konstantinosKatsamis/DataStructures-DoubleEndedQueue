# DataStructures-DoubleEndedQueue

Double-Ended Queue is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue. The elements in the queue can be added or removed from the front(first in our implementation) or from the back(last in our implementation) of the queue. The nodes are connected with next and previous pointers.
