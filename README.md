# DataStructures-DoubleEndedQueue

Double-Ended Queue is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue. The elements in the queue can be added or removed from the front(first in our implementation) or from the back(last in our implementation) of the queue. In our implementation, the nodes are connected with next and previous pointers.

In this repository the DEQ is implemented in Java and Python. In every version there is an interface file, implementation file and main which you can run the program and use the methods to manage your DEQ through a menu with the following options:

1. Add First. Add an element at the front of the queue

2. Remove First. Delete and return the item at the front of the queue

3. Add Last. Add an element at the end of the queue

4. Remove Last. Delete and return the item at the end of the queue

5. Get First. Get the first element of the queue

6. Get Last. Get the last element of the queue

7. Get the size of the Queue

8. Print Queue. Print the data of the queue

9. Exit. Stop the execution of the program
